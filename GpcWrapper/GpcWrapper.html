<h1>GpcWrapper</h1>

<p>
The GpcWrapper makes the Gpc-library available for .Net Programs. It contains some .Net-classes that mirrors the
gpc-structs for polygons, tristrips, ... <br>
</p>

<p>
The steps necessary to use it are described below.<br>
First you have to generate a .dll-File from the gpc.c and gpc.h file.
Afterwards you can compile your C# Program together with the File GpcWrapper.cs (using the GpcWrapper with another .Net language is not
described here). The gpc.dll will be loaded at execution time. So it has to be located e.g. in the same directory
as the compiled Program.
